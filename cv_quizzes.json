He fits tires with a friction coefficient of 1.8 (assume cylindrical friction ellipses) and a rolling resistance coefficient of 0.1. For the gravitational acceleration, assume the value that can be measured at the Hungaroring (ca. Budapest) rounded to 2 decimals . On the day of driving, George sees that the temperatures reach room temperature values according to ISO 13443 natural gas reference conditions. As he steps on the scale to measure his own weight, he also sees, that the poppy seed rolls from Christmas are still measurable in his belly and he still weighs 15 kg. At least how much speed does he need to maintain wh ile driving on the ceiling when the stated circumstances occur? Assume just he main forces acting on George and his vehicle (a point mass may be equivalent) in an equilibrium state to determine the minimum needed speed in a moment of bottom up driving.

You move the front roll centre higher, by moving the wishbones and steering rack pickup points higher on the chassis.\\nWe assume that:\\n- roll centre positions are static - they do not change when the car rolls,\\n- we do not take into account aerodynamic forces, tires deflection and race track is perfectly flat, non suspended mass and tires Mx are negligibly low (x is assumed as longitudinal axis).\\n- the car is symmetric, 50% front weight distribution, all motion ratios = 1, all spring stiffnesses are the same, 4 wheels are on the ground, coilovers do not reach their travel limit,\\n- the caster and KPI angle are equal 0, so we do not take into account any steer jacking,\\n- for the second run we do not change the centre gravity position, spring rates or motion ratios when changing the front roll centre height. The alignment, camber gain, bump steer, tires, track, wheelbase - all stays the same.\\nOn the front coilovers you run linear potentiometers. They read 0 when the car drives straight on a flat surface. We assume that they read the displacement as the absolute value. This means that no matter if the coilover is being compressed or extended, it gives positive value. You read with them 4 values:\\n- L1 - Front left coilover displacement on the first run\\n- R1 - Front right coilover displacement on the first run\\n- L2 - Front left coilover displacement on the second run\\n- R2 - Front right coilover displacement on the second run\\n\\nWhich set of equations is true for the last lap of the skid pad (left circle / left hand corner)?\\nWe are considering left hand corner, so left coilover potentiometers are being extended and right ones are being shortened.",

Both the sensors and the springs have linear characteristics in the measurement domain (F [N] spring force ~ Δs [m] spring ~ U [V] measured voltage).\\n First, you measure the mass of the car without the driver. On the front axle you measure the total mass of 81.8 [kg] (sum of left and right sides) and on the rear axle 88.3 [kg] (left and right side together). Meanwhile the average of the measured voltages of the two linear potentiometers on the front axle is 2.36 [V] and on the rear axle is 2.45 [V].\\n Then you also measure the mass of the car with the driver inside. The results are the following: 120.7 [kg] and 3.33 [V] on the front axle and 121.2 [kg] and 3.25 [V] on the rear axle. \\n Then your driver performs the constant velocity runs with the car. Based on the logs with the appropriate data filtering you calculate that the velocity was 60.48 [km/h] and on the front axle the average measured voltage was 4.26 [V], while on the rear it was 4.23 [V].\\n During the test you also operated a mobile mini weather station. From this you know that the ambient pressure was 103 [kPa] and the air temperature was 26.3 [°C]. The humidity was low; thus you can use 0.02896 [kg/mol] as the molecular mass of the air. Wind speed was 0.\\n The frontal surface of your vehicle is A = 1.14 [m^2]. Use g = 9.81 [m/s^2] as the constant for gravity.\\n Calculate your vehicle’s lift (downforce) coefficient from the results of the tesƟng! Calculate the position of the CoG and the CoP (relative to the wheelbase) at the velocity measured during the run!\\n Where is the CoP relative to the CoG?\\n From the options below select one cl [-] value and one CoG-CoP relationship option!",
